<p>Employee Kevin Hart is our Sales Manager. Kevin collects data from customers to increase sales so we can help the world with more organization! He changes prices on how much the demand is and as inflation levels change. He is also very comical!</p>
<p>Employee Hasbulla Magedov is our Artist and Product Manager. Hasbulla is very creative and designs most of our products and is always thinking of new ideas. Hasbulla teaches our other artists to make these products and how to properly transform raw material into our products. Pretty cool! Fun fact: Hasbulla is 3 feet tall</p>
<p>Employee Jayson Tatum is our Marketing Manager. Jayson has been a huge success for Eco-Design. He promotes our company so well. He runs all of our social media. Fun fact: Jayson is almost 7 feet!</p>
