            <h1>How We Do It</h1>
            <p>At EcoVoyage, we harness the power of technology and sustainability to create unforgettable, eco-friendly travel experiences.</p>
            <p>
                We use Microsoft Access to manage client bookings and ensure seamless itineraries. Excel helps us maintain detailed reports of costs, revenue, and carbon-offsetting contributions. Every detail, from the number of travelers to destination-specific data, is tracked to provide insights for improving our operations while minimizing our ecological footprint.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our operations team, led by Michael Vick, analyzes Excel reports to track which travel packages are most popular and align them with our sustainability goals. This data-driven approach ensures that we continue to offer trips that leave a positive impact on the environment and local communities.
