            <h1>How We Do It</h1>
            <p>
                At Eco-Design, we use Microsoft Excel and Access as super powerful tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft Access is extremely helpful for managing our inventory. We use Excel to keep track of our budget and costs/revenue. We use Excel to count the amount of material we have to give to the artists who make the products. We also use Excel to track sales. As a small business that started two years ago, we are making a bigger impact on the planet. The more customers we have, the more support Eco-Design receives, which supports planet Earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Sales Manager, Kevin Hart, monitors which products perform better and reports findings to the team. This has significantly increased our profits. We use line charts to observe trends in costs and revenue. Eco-Design also leverages Microsoft Access to maintain a database of customer information, including contact details, purchase history, and preferred products. This data is essential for promoting our business and raising awareness about environmental sustainability in our small town of Millis.
