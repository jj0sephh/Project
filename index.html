<p>
Eco-Design is a sustainable business that creates handcrafted home decor items made from recycled material, founded by Jack Halloran in April 2021. Jack is committed to minimizing its environmental impact by making products usimg recycled materials and eco-friendly packaging. Jack's idea of Eco-Design sparked at a young age when he would use his creativity to make things out of random materials for fun! Now, he can do the same thing, except he is helping the earth at the same time! The small business has came a long way, from selling just wreaths for doors to now selling recycled material of all sort.
</p>
<p>
The company's goal is to promote sustainable living by offering stylish and unique home decor that is both eco-friendly and affordable. The products are created by skilled artists that transform raw materials like wood scraps, plastic bottles, newspaper, scap metal, glass and more into beautiful and usable home decor. We want to make profits for our business so we can continue to fund our help for the earth by using waste to create new home decor.
